# Genome Characterization Center #
## Description ##
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) were responsible for characterizing the genomic changes found in the tumors studied by TCGA.
## Overview ##
The Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) were responsible for characterizing the genomic changes found in the tumors studied by TCGA. The GCCs used multiple platforms to provide data to the cancer research community on changes in microRNA and gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number changes. The GCCs also validated specific regions of interest through targeted sequencing.

The following groups, organized by area of focus, served as TCGA Genome Characterization Centers:


Focus | Location |
--- | --- | ---
__Copy Number Alteration (SNP Characterization)__ | Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.
  | The Broad Institute, Cambridge, Mass.
__Epigenomics__ | Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, Mich.
__Gene (mRNA) Expression__ | University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, N.C.
__microRNA (miRNA) Analysis__ | British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, B.C., Canada
__Targeted Sequencing Center__ | Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas
__Functional Proteomics__ | MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas
