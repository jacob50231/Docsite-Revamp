# Variant Call Annotation #
## Description ##

Variant call annotation adds information to [variant call format](LINK) files, which adds context and consequences for each variant.

## Overview ##

Variant call annotation is performed on all VCFs produced by the four variant calling pipelines. Annotation adds information to each variant including the biological consequences and the genes or 
regions affected. The annotation process also matches each variant to documented variants from external databases.
