# Gene Expression Quantification #
## Description ##

Gene expression quantification is the process in which RNA transcript levels are measured.

## Overview ##

Harmonized gene expression quantification files are available at the [GDC Data Portal](LINK) as [raw counts](LINK), normalized using [FPKM](LINK), and normalized using [FPKM-UQ](LINK). Raw counts are generated by HTSeq, which are normalized using custom scripts.

### Data Formats ###

All gene expression quantification files are available in [TSV format](LINK).
