# Binary Alignment Map (BAM) #
## Description ##
A Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) file is the compressed binary version of the [Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM)](https://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/sam.html|), a compact and indexable representation of nucleotide sequence alignments.
## Overview ##
Centers align sequence reads to a reference genome to produce a Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format file. The SAM file is then converted into a binary form, or Binary-sequence Alignment Format (BAM) file, for indexing to allow efficient random access of the data contained within.
### Structure ###
The structure of the BAM is available in the [BAM Specification](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) guide.
