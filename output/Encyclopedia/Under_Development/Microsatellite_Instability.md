# Microsatellite Instability #
## Description ##
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a form of hypermutation that occurs in some tumors due to defects in cellular DNA mismatch repair. MSI is characterized by frequent somatic mutations (i.e., cancer-specific mutations) that change the length of simple repeats (e.g., AAAAA..., GATAGATAGATA...)
