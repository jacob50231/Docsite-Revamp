# Read Group #
## Description ##

A Read Group is a group of sequencing reads from one lane of an Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiment.

## Overview ##

The [GDC Data Model](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model/gdc-data-model-components) relates read groups to aliquots for associating experimental data. Read groups, which can have different 
properties and insert lengths, are aligned separately and all read group alignments from one aliquot are then merged.
