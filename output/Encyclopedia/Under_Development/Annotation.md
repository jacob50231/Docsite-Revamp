# Annotation #
## Description ##
An annotation is an explanatory or critical comment,
or other in-context information (e.g., pattern, motif, link), that has been associated with data or other types of information.
## Overview ##
In the GDC, annotations are notes added to individual cases, samples, or files. Annotations are made available through the GDC Data Portal and GDC Application Programming Interface (API). Annotations can be browsed and searched based on a number of annotation properties (facets), such as the type of entity the annotation is attached to or the annotation category.
