# Data Freeze #
A Data Freeze refers to a complete or partial ban imposed on data changes.  
## Description ##

## Overview ##
"Data Freeze" is a policy status on a particular case where the existing data on that case, as of a data freeze date, are maintained and available at the GDC, but no new data will be added to that case. A "Data Freeze" is most frequently the result of subject withdrawal from a protocol (e.g. consent withdrawal), but the withdrawal date occurred after the data was published.
