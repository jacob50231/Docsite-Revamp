# Biospecimen Supplement #

## Description ##

A biospecimen supplement file contains biospecimen data that does not fit into the GDC Data Dictionary.

## Overview ##

The biospecimen supplement offers a way for submitters to include all existing biospecimen data even though it may not conform to the GDC Data Dictionary. The content of these files is not searchable via the API, may not fit the GDC Data Dictionary<sup>1</sup>, and can use different CDEs and vocabulary than other projects stored in the GDC.  

### Data Formats ###

Biospecimen Supplement files are available in the GDC Data Portal as case-level XML files. Most elements have an associated CDE-ID that can be queried at the CDE Browser website for additional information<sup>2</sup>.
