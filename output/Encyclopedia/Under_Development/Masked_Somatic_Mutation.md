# Masked Somatic Mutation #
## Description ##

Masked Somatic Mutations are Tab Separated Value (TSV) files that contain somatic mutations for all of the cases for a project. Masked Somatic Mutation files have been filtered for potential germline variants.  

## Overview ##

Masked Somatic Mutation files are available at the GDC as filtered versions of the [Aggregated Somatic Mutation](LINK) files.  A series of filters were used to remove potential germline variants or erroneous variant calls, which allows the files to exist in an
openly accessible state.    

### Data Formats ###

Masked Somatic Mutation files are in the tab-delimited Mutation Annotation Format (MAF). See the [GDC MAF Format](LINK) for details about each column. Each Masked Somatic Mutation file is generated from a corresponding Aggregated Somatic Mutation file, which is under [controlled-access](LINK) because it can potentially contain germline mutations.
