# BWA with Mark Duplicates and Cocleaning #
## Description ##

BWA with Mark Duplicates and Cocleaning is a DNA-Seq alignment and optimization process.   

## Overview ##

The DNA-Seq alignments available in the GDC Data Portal are a result of the BWA--> MarkDuplicates--> Cocleaning  workflow. Generating this data first involves aligning the DNA-Seq reads and then 
optimizing the alignments by running MarkDuplicates to ??????????????? and then the [CoCleaning Workflow](LINK).
