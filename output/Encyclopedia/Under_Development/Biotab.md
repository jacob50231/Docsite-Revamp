# Biotab #
## Description ##
A biotab file is a tab-delimited text file that contains TCGA clinical data. This file is auto-generated by the DCC through the Data Matrix application.

## Overview ##
Biotab files contain clinical or biospecimen data for multiple participants. They are likely to be a substantially more convenient alternative to clinical XML. Each line contains tab-separated data for a single participant or other object (for example, sample, aliquot). These files can be conveniently opened in a spreadsheet program such as Excel, where data can easily be sorted and extracted. Biotab files can also be sorted and manipulated with command line programs (such as the UNIX utilities cut, sort, uniq, grep and join), or exported to a local relational database (For example, MySQL or PostgreSQL).
