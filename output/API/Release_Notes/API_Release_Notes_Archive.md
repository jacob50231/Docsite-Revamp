## v0.2.15-oicr1

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: August 7, 2015

*   None to report

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

*   Addressed an issue in the range aggregation feature (used by facets)

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   Query and Download Service
    *   Universal Resource Locator (URL) length is limited.  As such, download requests with many files have to be divided into multiple requests. A feature that allows a payload to specify the file identifiers to download to overcome this limitation is planned for a future release.
    *   All TARGET, CGCI, and CCLE data is currently not available via the GDC API but will be made available as data is continously imported into the GDC
*   Authentication and Authorization Service
    *   Obtaining a token requires browser access. This is a limitation of eRA Commons and not the GDC authorization service. The Security Assertion Markup Language  (SAML) based protocol eRA Commons uses does not support [ECP](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/ECP) (or similar)
