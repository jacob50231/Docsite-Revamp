# Dictionary Viewer

## Overview

The Data Dictionary viewer provides access to GDC-wide dictionaries as well as specific dictionaries that can be applied to a specific project.

More details about dictionaries can be found in a dedicated section of the documentation [=>LINK TO GDC DICTIONARY DOCUMENTATION].

The Data Dictionary viewer is automatically updated from the GDC Data Dictionary and can considered an up-to-date view of the Data Dictionary.
